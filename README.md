# 🥇 Paris 2024 Olympics Dashboard – Power BI Project

Welcome to my Paris 2024 Olympics interactive dashboard project! As a data enthusiast and sports fan, I combined my passions to create a dynamic, data-driven tool that dives deep into the insights of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the Paris 2024 Olympics, offering real-time updates on medal tallies, athlete performances, country-wise comparisons, and historical trends—all within a sleek and user-friendly Power BI dashboard.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. **Seamless Data Modeling**  
The core of this project lies in robust data modeling. By establishing precise data relationships, the dashboard ensures intuitive navigation, enabling users to uncover insights at every level—from high-level summaries to detailed drill-downs.

### 2. **Mastering DAX Functions**  
Advanced DAX functions like `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, `DISTINCTCOUNT`, and custom measures are utilized to extract insights beyond surface-level stats. These functions drive the analytics behind medal counts, performance trends, and comparative analyses.

### 3. **Automated Data Collection with Python**  
To ensure data freshness, Python scripts are used to automate daily data collection and cleaning. This process guarantees the dashboard stays updated with the latest results in real-time, delivering timely insights just as the events unfold.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard is divided into four informative pages:

- **Overview:**  
  A comprehensive snapshot of the Paris 2024 Olympics, showcasing the overall medal tally, top-performing countries, and standout athletes.
