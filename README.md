Welcome to my Paris Olympics interactive dashboard project! As a data enthusiast and sports fan, I combined my passions to create a dynamic, data-driven tool that dives deep into the insights of the Paris Olympic Games.

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the Paris  Olympics, offering real-time updates on medal tallies, athlete performances, country-wise comparisons, and historical trends—all within a sleek and user-friendly Power BI dashboard.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. **Seamless Data Modeling**  
The core of this project lies in robust data modeling. By establishing precise data relationships, the dashboard ensures intuitive navigation, enabling users to uncover insights at every level—from high-level summaries to detailed drill-downs.

### 2. **Mastering DAX Functions**  
Advanced DAX functions like `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, `DISTINCTCOUNT`, and custom measures are utilized to extract insights beyond surface-level stats. These functions drive the analytics behind medal counts, performance trends, and comparative analyses.

### 3. **Automated Data Collection with Python**  
To ensure data freshness, Python scripts are used to automate daily data collection and cleaning. This process guarantees the dashboard stays updated with the latest results in real-time, delivering timely insights just as the events unfold.

The dashboard is divided into four informative pages:

- **Overview:**  
  A comprehensive snapshot of the Paris Olympics, showcasing the overall medal tally, top-performing countries, and standout athletes.

- **Athlete Performance Analysis:**  
  A deep dive into individual athlete performances across various sports. This page identifies trends, record-breakers, and emerging stars that might shine in future games like LA 2028.
  

- **Country-wise Analysis:**  
  Compare and analyze how countries perform across different sports. This page helps identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for strategic improvement in future competitions.

- **Historical Data Analysis:**  
  Explore past Olympic performances to gain context and spot trends that could predict future successes. It provides a long-term view of how countries and athletes have evolved over multiple Olympic cycles.

## 🚀 Strategic Insights and Future Potential
One exciting aspect of this project is the ability to identify sports where countries have untapped potential for LA 2028. By leveraging these insights, nations can fine-tune their strategies and maximize their chances of winning medals in the next Olympic Games.
